# ENGF0001 - Vaccine Bioreactor Project

Code which I wrote to supplement electronic circuits, to produce a subsystem for a Bioreactor Vaccine Plant in Uganda

ArduinoSketch.ino - Interacts with the Arduino, which is connected to the physical components.
ProcessingGUI.pde - Allows us to create a GUI in Processing Language, which allows the user to communicate with the Arduino.
